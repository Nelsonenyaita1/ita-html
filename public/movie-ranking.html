<h2>My top three movies I love most</h2>
 <hr />

<h3>Living in bondage</h3>
<p>The movie teaches hope and resilience in Life</p>

<h3>Wrath of Men</h3>
<p>This movie made understand that greed and selfishnss is bad and that this can easily destroy your Life</p>

<h3>State of the Union</h3>
<p>This movie is so facinating because it helps in revealing the weaknesses that comes
    with greed for power.
    it teaches morals on solid foundation to loyalty, because throughly it pays to be good and loyal
</p>

<h3>Mr Ibu</h3>
<p>
    This movie is very comic it nature because it best explains the environment of ruralites, on how love
    could be gotten even without having enough money that could also sustain the conforts.
